# UNO Game

In the Eclipse IDE, I created an automatic game of UNO using the basic Object-Oriented Programming principles, following the standard rules and logistics of the UNO Card Game. This game has 4 hard coded players that are each dealt a hand of 7 cards, runs through the full game, and determines a winner.

Below is an project overview poster discussing the planning process, coding methods used, the issues I faced while coding, and how the solutions I used to overcome those problems.

<h2>Design</h2>

In my application design stages, I created an in-depth flowchart showing all of the steps for each procedure within the main class, as well as a UML diagram to help guide in developing the variables and methods within each class.

<h2>Final Product</h2>

This project ended with the full running game being printed out to the console. Each turn the top card, user's hand, and card played were all displayed to make the game flow clear. I also used JavaFX for the user to be able to distinguish the cards easier, rather than trying to interpret R3, GSkip, WD+4, etc.
